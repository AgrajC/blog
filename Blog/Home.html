             Hello readers. I'm Agraj, an IIT JEE aspirant currently studying in class 11. Some people have warned me to be prepared to experience mental trauma! I guess they're exaggerating a lot. It's true there's been a huge leap from class 10. The syllabus is way too vast but I think I will manage it. And since I'm on a journey I thought why not to document my process. I will keep udapting about how I feel, what I'm doing right, what I'm doing wrong, etc on a weekly basis.
